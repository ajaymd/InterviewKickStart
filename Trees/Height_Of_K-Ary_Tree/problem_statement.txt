Height Of K-Ary Tree


Problem Statement:

Given a k-ary tree of size N. You have to find height of the tree. (Length of the longest path from root to any node.)

Due to some limitations currently it is not possible to provide k-ary tree. So, instead you are given two arrays from and to of size N - 1, which can be used to construct k-ary tree. Consider an edge from node from[i] to node to[i].

Construction of k-ary tree is not a part of the test. The thing you should focus on is how to find the height of the tree.    

Input Format:

There are three arguments. First one denotes integer k, second one denotes array from and third one denotes array to. 

Output Format:

Return an integer denoting height of the k-ary tree.

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= from[i], to[i] <= N
0 <= k <= N - 1
Node 1 will be the root of the tree.
Input will be a valid k-ary tree.

Sample Test Case:

Sample Input:

k = 3
from = [1 1 1 5]
to = [3 2 5 4]

Sample Output:

2

Explanation:

Given a 3-ary tree with 5 nodes. Node 1 has 3 children 3 2 and 5, and node 5 has one child 4.
Longest path from root is 1 -> 5 -> 4 and it's length is 2.
