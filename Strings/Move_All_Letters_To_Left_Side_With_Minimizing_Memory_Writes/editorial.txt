This is an easy question presented with fancy words.






Look at the solution provided by us.






Time Complexity:

O(|s|).
As we are traversing through the string.


Auxiliary Space Used:

O(1).


Space Complexity:

O(|s|).
As space complexity includes the input size also.
Note that generally we use Auxiliary Space Used = Space Complexity, but there is a different. Auxiliary space does not count the input size but space complexity does.
