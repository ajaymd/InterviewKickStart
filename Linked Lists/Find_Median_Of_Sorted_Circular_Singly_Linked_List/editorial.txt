If you are thinking that your code is correct and still you are getting wrong answer in some test cases then I would suggest you to 1) read problem statement again. You are given sorted which means "non-increasing" or "non-decreasing" 2) read constraints once again and then try. You are missing some special testcases. When even number of elements then we do (l + r) / 2 and numbers can be upto 2*10^9 so signle number can be stored in int but l + r will overflow. Use long long int and then try!! Try to figure out why it overflows as a homework. 

Now coming to actual solution, have a look at the code provided by us. It includes detailed comments.
